# CS120FinalProject
The goal of this project was to have a player trapped in a scary house, and try to figure a way out of it using items
The instructions are to click buttons to make descions throughout the game
The technology I used was Spyder, a python editor, with Simple.GE, a game engine my proffesor made
The techniques used were using nodes to go from one screen to another, using numbers to go to specific nodes, and naming the nodes which lined up with the title of the screen in the game
The only external resource I used was my professor's own choose your own adventure game as a base
The process of making this wasn't too bad, but there were defiently some bumps
I learned how important commets are, as I used numbers to keep track of my nodes
I got stuck when I was hitting one of the buttons, it would just end the game, but I figured out why by taking a step back, and taking a break
I would like to improve my object-oreinted progaming, as I belive i could of done a lot more if I really understood it
I would do things diffrently next time by choosing an entirely diffrent idea, as I kinda backed my self into a corner with this "easy" project
I strayed decently far from the design document, as I wasn't able to get any graphics or sound effects working
I stayed on path though by keeping the entire story I wrote in the design document, as that came together pretty well
